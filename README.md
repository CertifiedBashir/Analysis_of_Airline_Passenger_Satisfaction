## Introduction
> This project is the product of my continuous learning and getting my hands dirty with data analysis in Python.

**About Data**

This dataset was derived from the data playground of the Maven Analytics platform.

**Background info and context**

Customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, as well as ther evaluation of different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.

**Recommended Analysis:** The following are the questions I will be solving through out the analysis:
1. Which percentage of airline passengers are satisfied? Does it vary by customer type? What about type of travel?
2. What is the customer profile for a repeating airline passenger?
3. Does flight distance affect customer preferences or flight patterns?
4. Which factors contribute to customer satisfaction the most? What about dissatisfaction?
